# Solution

```
Get as many printers as I need until I reach number of statues
Print all statues on the same day since i have more or equal number of printer than statues
Unless I only need to do 1 statue then it's more beneficial to print all printers
```

```
Days     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
Printers | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16
```
